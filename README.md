# Video Resolution Enhancement Project

## Overview
This project focuses on enhancing the resolution of a video using basic algorithms.

## Frame Extraction
Utilized OpenCV to extract frames from the input video, enabling further processing on individual frames.

## Resolution Enhancement Algorithms
1. **Nearest-neighbor Interpolation**: Implemented a basic algorithm to enhance the resolution of frames using nearest-neighbor interpolation.
2. **Bilinear Interpolation**: Applied bilinear interpolation to improve the resolution of the extracted frames, resulting in smoother transitions between pixels.
3. **Bicubic Interpolation**: Implemented bicubic interpolation to further enhance the resolution of frames, offering better quality compared to bilinear interpolation.

## Video Reconstruction
After enhancing the frames with each interpolation method, reconstructed the video by merging the enhanced frames while maintaining the original frame rate. 

## Output Videos
Generated separate videos for each interpolation method, showcasing the differences in quality and visual appearance.

## Skills Demonstrated
This project highlights proficiency in video processing using OpenCV, understanding and implementation of basic image interpolation algorithms, and ability to reconstruct videos while preserving their original characteristics such as frame rate.
